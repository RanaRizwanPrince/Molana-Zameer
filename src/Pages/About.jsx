He belonged to the village of Bagnotar in the Galiyat area of ​​Abbottabad district. He was born in 1916 to Maulana Ghulam Yahya Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him), the leader of the caravan of Syed Ismail Shaheed (may Allah have mercy on him). He was a scholar of Darul Uloom Deoband. Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him) was a Rasheed student of Hazrat Maulana Yusuf Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him). He fought for the sake of the Word of Allah and against polytheism and innovation throughout his life. He participated in the struggle for the independence of Pakistan. He led the jihad from his area against the atrocities of the Sikhs. He founded the Idara Taalim-ud-Din (Institute of Islamic Studies). He passed away on June 7, 2011.</p>

The struggle of the scholars of the subcontinent has always played the role of a beacon for the new generation. One of these distinguished personalities is the name of Maulana Jamil Ahmed Qureshi, who was not only a religious scholar but also a patriotic soldier, teacher, sage and a reformist elder. His life was a beautiful combination of simplicity, hard work, sacrifice and sincerity.</p>
                                <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Early conditions and education</h1>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">Maulana Jamil Ahmed Qureshi was born in 1954 in a religious and scholarly family in the village of Bagnotar in Abbottabad district. His father, Maulana Zamir Ahmed Qureshi, was one of the renowned scholars of the region who lit the lamp of religious education and training in the area. Therefore, he received his early religious education from his father Majid.</p>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">He started his modern education from Government Primary School, Bagnotar and later completed his education up to the eighth grade from Government High School, Bagnotar. For further education, he moved to Nawanshahr, where he enrolled in the Madrasa Ghari Bhanna of Sheikh-ul-Hadith Hazrat Maulana Saeed-ur-Rehman Qureshi for religious education and simultaneously obtained his matriculation certificate from Government High School, Nawanshahr.</p>
                                <h1 data-aos="fade-up">A journey of religious education</h1>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">After completing his initial books, he joined Madrasa Anwar-ul-Islam, Kehal Abbottabad, founded by Hazara preacher Maulana Mufti Shafiqur-ur-Rehman Qureshi. Here he attained the highest heights of religious knowledge for about six years. Later, he went to the famous Madrasa Nusrat-ul-Uloom in Gujranwala for a course in Hadith and completed some books there. Then he went to Jamia Ashrafia, Lahore and completed a course in Hadith from there and obtained a certificate of graduation.</p>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">Thus, he received the grace of the prominent religious institutions of the subcontinent and benefited from the company of various eminent scholars.</p>
                                <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Contemporary education and wisdom</h1>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">Along with religious studies, he also pursued modern education. He obtained degrees of FA, BA, MA (Arabic) and MA (Islamic Studies) from Peshawar Board and Peshawar University. Furthermore, due to his special interest in medicine and wisdom, he completed a four-year course from Tayyaba College, Lahore and obtained a certificate in wisdom. This shows that he was a versatile personality who excelled in both religious and modern sciences.</p>
                                <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Service in the Army</h1>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">Maulana Jamil Ahmed Qureshi joined the Education Corps of the Pakistan Army in 1980 as a Deputy Khateeb. Due to his ability, hard work and integrity, he rose through the ranks to the rank of Khateeb-e-Ala Subedar Major. This honor is not only a reflection of his academic and moral abilities but also a proof that he represented religion in an institution that is the protector of the country and the nation.</p>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">During his service in the army, he enlightened thousands of youth with religion, morality, and character. His speeches and advice had an impact on hearts. Even in military life, he remained a model of simplicity, piety, and sincerity.</p>
                                <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Father's legacy and Taalimuddin Madrasa</h1>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">Maulana Jamil Ahmed Qureshi's father, Maulana Zamir Ahmed Qureshi, had founded the Madrasa Taleemuddin in the village of Bagnotar. This institution was the center of religious education and training in the area. Maulana Jamil Ahmed Qureshi's dream was to return to his village after retirement from the army and serve this madrasa and develop it on modern lines. He was determined to equip the new generation with the knowledge of both religion and worldly life and to spread the message of Islam.</p>
                                <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Martyrdom and death</h1>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">Unfortunately, he did not get the chance to fulfill this dream. On the morning of August 14, 2005, he was on his way to the unit's mosque for Fajr prayers when terrorists attacked him and seriously injured him. The incident was later described as a road accident. He remained in a coma at CMH Lahore for two years and finally met his true Creator on May 25, 2007. Inna lillahi wa na ilahi raji'un</p>
                                <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Survivors and family relationships</h1>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">Maulana Jamil Ahmad Qureshi left behind four sons (Anas Jamil Qureshi, Ehsanullah Qureshi, Rizwanullah Qureshi, Taha Saif Qureshi) and one daughter. He was related to the famous religious scholar Hazrat Maulana Mufti Shafiqur Rahman Qureshi, Khatib Hazara, as a son-in-law, while the current Khatib Hazara was the brother-in-law of Hazrat Maulana Mufti Hameed-ur-Rehman Qureshi.</p>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">He achieved, represented religion in the army, kept the passion for social reform in his heart and finally sacrificed his life and attained the status of martyrdom. Your memory and services will always live on in the list of scholars of Hazara history and the subcontinent.</p>
