                        <h3>Early life and education:</h3>
                        <p>In 1916, in the Gultur Valley of Abbottabad, a mountainous region of the subcontinent, a child was born whose forehead was shining with the light of knowledge and action. He was Maulana Zamir Ahmad Qureshi Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him). He belonged to a religious and scholarly family. His father, Maulana Ghulam Yahya Qureshi Hashmi, was a prominent religious scholar and a righteous person of the area. He received his early education from his respected father, then he read books in the schools of Gigian Rewabia and Goldbrain. The love for religious education was instilled in him from childhood, and this passion took him to India, where he enrolled in Darul Uloom Deoband. Educational journey and company of elders During his education, he got the company of great scholars of the subcontinent. After Deoband, he was associated with the academic centers of Diamond and Saharanpur, where he was blessed with the studentship of the great Muhaddith, Quran commentator and the spirit of the Pakistan Movement, Hazrat Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him). Under his patronage, he completed his knowledge of thought and religious sciences. Return to Gultur and Reform Struggle: When he returned to his homeland in 1939 after completing his education, the darkness of polytheism and innovation was shrouding the village. He took up the duty of reforming the nation and lit the candle of truth in this environment with great wisdom and patience. His principle was that he would not make religion a means of earning worldly gain. With this aim in mind, he joined the Army Medical Corps (A.M.C.) in search of a halal livelihood and served with distinction for four years.</p>
