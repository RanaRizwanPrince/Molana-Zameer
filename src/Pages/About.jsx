                                <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani is a symbol of a movement.</h1>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">Among the bright and faith-inspiring chapters of the history of the subcontinent is one that was written with a combination of knowledge, action, and religious zeal. This chapter is attributed to the name of Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him). He was not just a scholar, but a movement. A movement that arose to awaken the Ummah with the light of the Quran, the power of knowledge, and the warmth of faith. This believing man, who opened his eyes in Aligarh in 1887, received the light of knowledge from the teachers of Darul Uloom Deoband, which later became a beacon on the horizon of the subcontinent.</p>
                                <p>The spirituality of Sheikh-ul-Hind Maulana Mahmud-ul-Hasan and Hakim-ul-Ummat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi, and the knowledge and courage of Khalil Ahmed Saharanpuri, the fragrance of all these came together in your personality. As Sheikh-ul-Hadith in Darul-Uloom and Dakal, you gave the new generation not only the light of knowledge, but also intellectual, faith-based, and national consciousness. Tafsir Usmani was not just an academic service, but an intellectual revolution. That interpretation of the Quran that soothes the intellect and warms the faith. But Allama Usmani's vision was not limited to the confines of the school and the country. When the country was in the clouds of decline, and Muslims in the United States were losing their identity, he stepped into the new field of politics. He said that separating religion and state is the weakness of the nation. Islam is a complete code of life. With this thought, you established Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Pakistan so that Allama could take on the leadership of the nation along with truth and religion. Your voice became a spiritual challenge in the Pakistan Movement. Standing by the side of the Quaid-e-Azam, you proved that the establishment of Pakistan is a religious goal, not a mere geographical change. On August 14, 1947, when the flag of Pakistan was raised, tears of gratitude were flowing from the eyes of a divine scholar, Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani, in its shadow. This scene was actually the victory of the struggle of religion, behind which there was a long story of faith, knowledge, and sacrifice. Even after the formation of Pakistan, you did not sit silent. You put the spirit of the Constitution of Pakistan in the form of declarations and objectives so that the foundation of this country would be firmly established on Islam. When you left this world in December 1949, an existence came to an end, but a movement came to life and that movement is still calling us today! Rise up! Return this homeland to the goal for which Allama Usmani dreamed. Today, we need to take Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani's thought as a torch and advise us on action and life. He teaches us action with knowledge, and character with faith. Allama Usmani was not a scholar, but a metaphor for a movement. The pride of Islamic consciousness, and the movement for the ideological defense of Pakistan. Let us follow in his footsteps and renew the same resolve once again. May the message of the Quran be spread, and may Pakistan become the fortress of Islam!</p>

                                <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Allama Muhammad Yusuf Banuri, may God have mercy on him</h1>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">In the scientific and religious history of the subcontinent, the name of Allama Muhammad Yusuf Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him) is very prominent among those personalities who have improved the intellectual and practical aspects of the Ummah with their knowledge, actions, sincerity and determination. He was not just a religious scholar but a movement that left deep impressions in the fields of knowledge and action, teaching and training, reform and invitation, and politics and leadership. Allama Banuri was born in 1908 in an academic and religious family. He received his early education there and later went to Darul Uloom Deoband. Where he acquired the knowledge of Hadith from renowned teachers of the subcontinent such as Shaykh-ul-Islam Hazrat Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him), Maulana Hussain Ahmad Madani (may Allah have mercy on him) and Sheikh Yaqub Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him). He had a special affinity and devotion to Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani in particular, which later became his academic and intellectual identity. The most prominent aspect of his life is the establishment of Darul Uloom Islamia Banuri Town Karachi, which today has the status of a central academic and intellectual reference point all over the world. This institution has produced hundreds of scholars who are engaged in the propagation of religion, teaching and reforming society not only in Pakistan but also all over the world. This institution is actually a manifestation of Allama Banuri's sincerity, foresight and true thinking. Allama Banuri's pen also used to wage jihad. His pen was like a sword against false ideologies.</p>
                                <p>The courage and insight with which you established an intellectual and intellectual front against Qadianism, esoteric ideas, Western colonialism, and al-Haad is a clear proof of your religious zeal and devotion. Your articles, statements, and writings are still considered a source of guidance in the academic world. Your students and lovers always testified that Allama Banuri's heart was filled with the pain of knowledge and invitation. Every speech of yours was an invitation, every lesson an Islamic message, and every meeting an advice. You always called for utmost help, sincerity of action, and beneficial knowledge. Along with your academic services, your role was also unparalleled. Your role in the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and the World Majlis Tahaffuz Khatm-e-Nubuwwat is an important chapter in the religious and intellectual journey of Pakistan's history. You always struggled to keep religion dominant over politics and introduced scholars as leaders of the nation. You passed away in 1977, but the movement you founded is still alive today. Every student, every scholar, and every voice rising from every pulpit at Jamia Darul Uloom Islamia Banuri Town is actually the legacy of the believing man who said it.</p>
                                <p>Serving religion is not only through preaching and advice, but also through knowledge, character and organization. Undoubtedly, the personality of Allama Muhammad Yusuf Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him) was such a movement that is still giving direction to the intellectual and religious journey of the Muslim Ummah today. His name has become a symbol of knowledge and action, insight and sincerity, and invitation and leadership.</p>

                                <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Maulana Zameer Ahmad Qureshi Hashmi is a reformer of education with action and the stain of Tawheed and Sunnah</h1>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">Early life and education: In 1916, in the Bhagalpur valley of the mountainous region of the subcontinent, a child was born whose forehead was shining with the light of knowledge and deeds. He was Maulana Zamir Ahmad Qureshi Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him). He belonged to a religious and scholarly family. His father, Hazrat Maulana Ghulam Mustafa Qureshi Hashmi, was a prominent religious scholar and a righteous person of the area. He received his early education from his father, then he read elementary books in the schools of Ranpur and Rohilkhand. The passion for religious knowledge was instilled in him from childhood. This passion took him to India, where he enrolled in Darul Uloom Deoband. During his educational journey and the company of elders, he got the company of the great scholars of the subcontinent. After Deoband, he was associated with the academic centers of Dhaka and Saharanpur. Here he was blessed with the discipleship of Sheikh-ul-Hadith, Quran interpreter and the spirit of the Pakistan Movement, Hazrat Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him). Under his patronage, he improved his knowledge and completed his religious studies. Return to Bhagalpur and Reform Struggle When he returned to his homeland in 1939 after completing his education, the darkness of polytheism and innovation was prevailing in the village. He made reform his first duty and lit the candle of truth in this environment with great wisdom and insight. His principle was that he would not make religion a means of earning worldly gain. With this aim in mind, he joined the Army Medical Corps (A.M.C) in search of a halal livelihood and served as a nursing soldier for four years.</p>
                                <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Teaching journey</h3>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">In 1946, he joined the Education Department and was appointed as a school teacher in Ugar Akari. His teaching career illuminated countless lives. His distinguished students include: Justice Sardar Raza Khan (ex-Mira), Sardar Muhammad Riaz (ex-Secretary C&W), Sardar Jamshed Sardar Khan. Along with teaching, he also performed the duties of Imamat and Khattab in mosques and imparted religious awareness to hundreds of people. In 1953, he was appointed as an Islamic teacher in Government High School Ghazi. Later, he served in Sirikot, Dawn City and finally High School Bhutto. His total teaching tenure spanned 38 years.</p>
                                <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Tablighi and Reformatory Services:</h3>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">After retirement in 1975, he turned his life towards purely religious and missionary work. He spent a long period of one year with the Tablighi Jamaat and upon his return, he served as a preacher in various mosques, including: Jamia Masjid Abu Bakr, Jamia Masjid Habibullah Kaka and Jamia Masjid Sawar Gadhi.</p>
                                <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Islamic Madrasa Taalimuddin and Jamia Masjid Tehba Banghro</h3>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">In his last years, he accomplished a great religious feat in the village of Banghro. He founded the Jamia Masjid Tehba Madrasa Islamia Taalimuddin Wa Jamilabad Banghro, which was later registered with the Federation of Arab Educational Institutions of Pakistan (Multan). This institution proved to be a source of light of knowledge and faith for the boys and girls of the village and surrounding areas. Under the curriculum of the Federation of Arab Educational Institutions of Pakistan, dozens of male and female students graduated from here adorned with the ornaments of religious education. This madrasa was established in the memory of Hafiz and Qari Zameer Ahmed Qureshi Shaheed (may Allah have mercy on him), which is an ongoing charity for his grandson.</p>
                                <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Farewell:</h3>
                                <p data-aos="fade-up">This reformer, teacher, and preacher of religion passed away in 2011. We belong to Allah and we shall return. His memory still resonates in the doors and walls of Bhagalpur. His students, lovers, and scholars pay tribute to his character and service. Maulana Zamir Ahmed Qureshi Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him) was not only a religious scholar and teacher, but he was a movement—the Movement for Knowledge and Reform, the Movement for the Rejection of Bid’ah and Shirk, and the Movement for the Revival of the Sunnah. His life teaches us that teaching religion is worship, and adhering to religion is the greatest expression of closeness to God.</p>
