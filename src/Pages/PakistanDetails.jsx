                        <p>Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani (RA) was a great scholar and spiritual leader who first hoisted Pakistan’s national flag and led Quaid-e-Azam’s funeral prayer. His devotion, faith, and vision laid the spiritual foundation of Pakistan and continue to inspire generations.</p>

                        <h3>The first person to hoist the flag in Pakistan was Shaykh-ul-Islam Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him).</h3>
                        <p>Shaykh-ul-Islam Hazrat Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him) is a unique figure in the Islamic world in his knowledge, grace, asceticism and piety. No one else could have produced such a great public speaker, such a great hadith scholar and jurist, such a great commentator and writer, and such a great religious scholar, a witness of the times. You could call him the Sahaban of his time, the Bukhari and Muslim of his time, the Abu Hanifa and Malik of his time, and the Razi of his time, and it would not be out of place. Who will rise in Islamic India now who will excel in the field of oratory and create a stir. And if he starts writing, he will write inspired interpretations of the hadiths of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) like Fath al-Mulham. And he will sit down to write the interpretation of his great teacher Hazrat Sheikh al-Hind Mahmud al-Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) and the translation, footnotes and benefits of the Holy Quran. He will continue to support the heights of thought of his great teacher for a long time.</p>
                        <p>When the political affairs of Islamic India became very complicated in the last quarter century, the late Mr. Jinnah's vision of choosing the same personality emerged whom the Almighty had prepared to do the fundamental work in this regard. The historian of the near future will never forget that when an attempt was made to undermine the concept of Pakistan in the former Frontier Province, the issue of Bengal politics became complicated, and the Muslim League's vision came to fruition in the former Sindh and Balochistan, Hazrat Shaykh-ul-Islam's enchanting power of speech, linguistic knowledge and grace, and political awareness changed the course of the situation, and the personality of the late Mr. Jinnah came in handy in implementing the program of the Muslim League.</p>
                        <p>In 1946-47, when the market of killing and bloodshed was hot in Calcutta, Bihar, Pada, Nawa Khuli, Garh Muktisar, you, while addressing a gathering in Deoband, said, "Muslims! If you want to live, learn to love death."</p>
                        <h3>From what I have seen in history, I have come to believe that those who do not know how to die do not know how to live.</h3>
                        <p>After the partition of the country, when the defense of Pakistan was threatened and on the other hand, due to the cunning tricks of the Hindus, the British, and the plants planted by the British, the life of Kashmiri Muslims was short. Kashmiri Muslims were forced to start a war of independence, and it was Hazrat Allama Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him) whose efforts led the scholars and grand muftis of the entire Islamic world to issue a fatwa that Jihad in Kashmir is obligatory. And the defense of Pakistan is also an important religious issue and Hazrat Usmani played the biggest role in drawing the attention of the Islamic world to this sacred duty. It is possible that some people may claim that because of us, Pakistan became aware of Islamic countries, but it is a fact that the world does not know them to the extent that Hazrat Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him) and his supporters know. Not only that, but when the word spread throughout the country that we want the government of Islam and Islamic law because it was said that what Pakistan means is La ilaha illallah, then there was a lot of controversy. Even then, as a respected member of the Central Assembly of Pakistan, you passed a resolution through your efforts, which for a long time became the topic of discussion in the entire press and platform under the name of the Objectives Resolution. In which the supreme sovereignty was considered to be only the essence of God Almighty. And there was a promise to make and mold the law of the country in accordance with the Islamic Sharia, but unfortunately, that resolution also died with the martyrdom of the late Liaquat Ali and the death of Hazrat Allama (may Allah have mercy on him). May there be a message of life in martyrdom too.</p>
                        <p>Today, in this country, you can see the old traces of Islamic civilization and some Islamic schools and spiritual monasteries, and their survival and preservation is certainly due to the efforts and noble impressions or evidence of Hazrat Mamduh. Otherwise, you would not be able to see so much in this country today.</p>
                        <p>Shaykh-ul-Islam Hazrat Maulana Shabbir Ahmed Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him) was also the former head of Darul Uloom Deoband. Islamic sciences and arts are not just a school of learning and a monastery of Sufism and morality, but a historical monument of the greatness of the Muslims of India. It is a school of thought that gave the Islamic nation the spirit of freedom, independence and equality and the protection of Islamic values ​​and ideologies. It was the excellence of this spirit that he played a key role in the struggle for the independence of Pakistan with the founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah (may Allah have mercy on him) and, by correctly representing the Muslims of the subcontinent, the first flag-hoisting of the flag of the second Islamic ideological state of the Islamic world, God willing, Pakistan, was performed by Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him) in the presence of the founder of Pakistan. Then, according to the will of the founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah (may Allah have mercy on him), he also led his funeral prayer. These events are a shining example of his sincere struggle in establishing an Islamic state - may Allah have mercy on him.</p>
