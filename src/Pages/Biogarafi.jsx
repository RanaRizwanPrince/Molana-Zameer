                        <h1>Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him) — A symbol of a movement</h1>
                        <p>Among the bright and faith-inspiring chapters of the history of the subcontinent is one that was written with a combination of knowledge, action, and religious zeal — this chapter is attributed to the name of Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him). He was not just a scholar, but a movement. A movement that arose to awaken the Ummah with the light of the Quran, the power of knowledge, and the fervor of faith.</p>
                        <p>This man of faith, who opened his eyes in an academic environment in 1887, received the light of knowledge from the teachers of Darul Uloom Deoband, which later became a beacon of light on the horizon of the subcontinent. The insight of Sheikh-ul-Hind Maulana Mahmud-ul-Hasan (RA), the spirituality of Hakim-ul-Ummat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi (RA), and the understanding of Hadith of Khalil Ahmed Saharanpuri (RA), the fragrance of all these came together in his being.</p>
                        <p>As Sheikh of Hadith at Darul Uloom Dahbel, you not only imparted knowledge to the new generation, but also religious thought, a spirit of faith, and national consciousness. "Tafsir-e-Uthmani" was not just an academic service, but an intellectual revolution — a commentary on the Quran that soothes the intellect and warms the faith.</p>
                        <p>But Allama Usmani's vision was not limited to the school of thought. When the nation was engulfed in the clouds of decline, and Muslims were losing their identity in Indian politics, he stepped from the pulpit to the field of politics. He said:</p>
                        <h3>Separating religion and politics is the weakness of the Ummah. Islam is a complete code of life.</h3>
                        <p>With this thought in mind, you established the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam — so that the Ulema-e-Haqq Din (religious scholars) could also take on the leadership of the nation. Your voice in the Pakistan Movement became a spiritual challenge. Standing alongside Quaid-e-Azam, you proved that the establishment of Pakistan was a religious goal, not a mere geographical change.</p>
                        <p>When the flag of Pakistan was raised on August 14, 1947, tears of gratitude were flowing from the eyes of a divine scholar in its shadow — Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani. This scene was actually a victory of the struggle for religion, behind which was a long story of faith, knowledge, and sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>Even after the creation of Pakistan, you did not sit still. You molded the spirit of the Constitution of Pakistan in the form of the Resolution of Objectives — so that the foundation of this country would remain firmly based on Islam.</p>
                        <p>When you left this world in December 1949, an existence ended, but a movement came to life — a movement that still calls out to us today:</p>
                        <h3>Rise up! Return this homeland to the goal for which Allama Usmani dreamed.</h3>
                        <p>Today, we need to take the thoughts of Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani out of books and make them a manifesto for life. He teaches us action with knowledge, and character with faith.</p>
                        <p>Allama Usmani is not a scholar, but a metaphor for a movement.</p>
                        <p>A movement for Islamic consciousness, national pride, and ideological defense of Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Let us follow in their footsteps and renew the same commitment once again:</p>
                        <p>May the message of the Quran be spread, may Pakistan become an Islamic system!</p>

                        <h1>Allama Muhammad Yusuf Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him) — Not a personality, but a movement</h1>
                        <p>In the scientific and religious history of the subcontinent, the name of Allama Muhammad Yusuf Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him) stands out among those figures who, through their knowledge, actions, sincerity and determination, have shaped the intellectual and practical aspects of the Ummah. He was not just a religious scholar but a movement that left deep impressions in the fields of knowledge and action, teaching and training, reform and invitation, and politics and leadership.</p>
                        <p>Allama Banuri was born in 1908 in a scholarly and religious family in Kandahar (Afghanistan). He received his early education there and later went to Darul Uloom Deoband, where he acquired knowledge from renowned teachers of the subcontinent such as Shaykh-ul-Islam Hazrat Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him), Maulana Hussain Ahmad Madani (may Allah have mercy on him) and Sheikh Yaqub Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him). In the science of Hadith, he had a special affinity and devotion, especially to Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him), and this affinity later became his academic and intellectual identity.</p>
                        <p>The most prominent aspect of his life is the establishment of "Darul Uloom Islamia Banuri Town Karachi", which today is an academic and intellectual center all over the world. This institution has produced hundreds of scholars who are engaged in the propagation of religion, teaching and reforming society not only in Pakistan but also all over the world. This institution is actually a manifestation of Allama Banuri's sincerity, foresight and organizational thinking.</p>
                        <p>Allama Banuri's pen was also engaged in jihad. His pen was like a sword against false ideologies. The courage and insight with which he established an intellectual and intellectual front against Qadianism, esoteric ideas, Western colonialism, and atheism is a clear proof of his religious zeal and devotion. His articles, statements, and writings are still considered a source of guidance in the academic world.</p>
                        <p>His students and admirers always testified that Allama Banuri's heart was filled with the pain of knowledge and invitation. Every speech of his was an invitation, every lesson a message of reform, and every meeting an advice. He always called for unity of the Ummah, sincerity of action, and beneficial knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Along with his academic services, his organizational role was also unparalleled. His role in Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and the World Islamic Relations is an important chapter in the religious and intellectual journey of Pakistan's history. He always struggled to keep religion dominant over politics and introduced the scholars as the leaders of the nation.</p>
                        <p>He passed away in 1977, but the movement he founded lives on. Every student, every scholar, and every voice rising from the pulpit of Banuri Town is the legacy of this man of faith who said:</p>
                        <h3>Serving religion is not just through sermons and advice, but also through knowledge, character, and organization.</h3>
                        <p>Undoubtedly, the personality of Allama Muhammad Yusuf Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him) was such a movement that even today is giving direction to the intellectual and religious journey of the Muslim Ummah. His name has become a symbol of knowledge and action, insight and sincerity, and invitation and leadership.</p>

                        <h1>Maulana Zamir Ahmed Qureshi Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him)</h1>
                        <p>A reformer, a practical teacher, and a proponent of monotheism and the Sunnah</p>
                        <p>Early life and education</p>
                        <p>In the Bagnutar Valley of Abbottabad, a mountainous region of the subcontinent, a child was born in 1916, whose forehead was adorned with the light of knowledge and action — he was Maulana Zamir Ahmad Qureshi Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him). He belonged to a religious and scholarly family. His father, the venerable Hazrat Maulana Ghulam Yahya Qureshi Hashmi, was a prominent religious scholar and a man of truth in the area.</p>
                        <p>He received his early education from his father, then studied elementary books in the schools of the village of Rewaiya and Kokal Barsin. The passion for religious knowledge was instilled in him since childhood, and this passion took him to India, where he enrolled in Darul Uloom Deoband.</p>
                        <h3>Educational travel and companionship of elders</h3>
                        <p>During his education, he was in the company of great scholars of the subcontinent. After Deoband, he was associated with the academic centers of Dabhil and Saharanpur. Here, he was blessed with the discipleship of the great Muhaddith, Quran commentator and the spirit of the Pakistan Movement, Hazrat Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him). Under his patronage, he refined his knowledge and perfected his religious studies.</p>
                        <h3>The return of Bagnutr and the reform struggle</h3>
                        <p>When he returned home after completing his education in 1939, the village was shrouded in the darkness of polytheism and innovation. He took up the duty of reforming the Ummah and lit the candle of truth in this environment with great wisdom and patience. His principle was that I will not make religion a means of earning worldly gain. With this aim in mind, he joined the Army Medical Corps (A.M.C) in search of a halal livelihood and served as a nursing soldier for four years.</p>
                        <h3>Teaching journey</h3>
                        <p>In 1946, he joined the Education Department and was appointed as a primary school teacher. His teaching career enlightened countless minds. His distinguished students include:</p>
                        <p>Justice Sardar Raza Khan (Namli Mira)</p>
                        <p>Sardar Muhammad Riaz (Former Secretary C&W)</p>
                        <p>Sardar Rahim Dad</p>
                        <p>Sardar Farhan</p>
                        <p>Along with teaching, he performed the duties of imam and preacher in mosques and imparted religious awareness to hundreds of people.</p>
                        <p>In 1953, he was appointed as an Islamic Studies teacher at Government High School Ghazi.</p>
                        <p>Later, he served at Sirikot, Nawanshahr, and finally at High School Bagnotar.</p>
                        <p>Your total teaching tenure spanned 38 years.</p>
                        <h1>Propaganda and reformation services</h1>
                        <p>After retirement in 1975, he turned his life towards purely religious and missionary work. He spent a long period of a year with the Tablighi Jamaat and upon his return served as a preacher in various mosques, including:</p>
                        <p>Jamia Mosque Upper Kahal</p>
                        <p>Jamia Mosque Murree</p>
                        <p>Jamia Mosque Dilkha Marri</p>
                        <p>Jamia Masjid Habibullah Colony</p>
                        <p>Jami Masjid Sawar Street are prominent.</p>
                        <h3>Islamic Madrasah Taalimuddin and Jamia Mosque Quba Bagnutr</h3>
                        <p>In his last years, he performed a great religious feat in the village of Bagnutr. He founded the Jamia Masjid Quba and Madrasa Islamia Taalimuddin Jamilabad Bagnutr, which was later formally registered with the Federation of Arab Schools of Pakistan (Multan).</p>
                        <p>This institution proved to be a source of light of knowledge and faith for the boys and girls of the village and its surroundings. Dozens of male and female students graduated from here adorned with the ornaments of religious education under the curriculum of Wafaq Al-Madaris Al-Arabiya Pakistan. This madrasa was established in the memory of Hafiz and Qari Saghir Ahmed Qureshi Shaheed (may Allah have mercy on him), which is an ongoing charity for his family.</p>
                        <h1>Separation</h1>
                        <p>This man of truth, this patient teacher, this preacher of religion appeared before his true Creator in 2011. We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return.</p>
                        <p>Your memory still resonates within the walls and doors of Bagnotr. Your students, devotees, and scholars pay tribute to your character and service.</p>
                        <p>Maulana Zamir Ahmed Qureshi Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him) was not only a religious scholar and teacher, but he was a movement. The movement of knowledge and reform, the movement of sincerity and action. The movement of rejecting innovation and polytheism, the movement of revitalizing the Sunnah His life teaches us that:</p>
                        <p>Learning religion is worship, teaching religion is service, and adhering to religion is the highest level of closeness to God.</p>

                        <h1>Introduction to the conscience</h1>
                        <p>Bazm-e-Zamir is an academic, intellectual and reformist movement that originated from the blessed lineage of Hazrat Maulana Zamir Ahmad Qureshi Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him) of Bagnutar, Abbottabad District (Father of Darul Uloom Deoband). This Bazm is a continuation of his academic and spiritual achievements, which aims to create religious awareness, intellectual awakening and reformist spirit among the youth of the Islamic nation.</p>
                        <p>The establishment of Bazm-e-Zamir is not just an organizational initiative, but a symbol of an intellectual and movement-based commitment that is striving to awaken the collective conscience of the Ummah, understand the Islamic way of life, and implement it on a practical level.</p>
                        <h3>Message of conscience</h3>
                        <p>The message of the Bazm-e-Zamir is simple but revolutionary: Revival of religion, reform of the nation, and awakening of conscience. This Bazm wants the Muslim Ummah to connect with the scientific and spiritual tradition of its predecessors, determine its true destination in the light of the Quran and Sunnah, and unite for the advancement of Islam on a practical level.</p>
                        <p>Awakening the conscience of the nation, reviving the religion is our responsibility.</p>
                        <h3>Invitation</h3>
                        <p>"Bazm-e-Zamir" is an intellectual and spiritual movement established to advance the scholarly and reformist tradition of the great men of Deoband, to disseminate the message of the Quran and Sunnah, and to unite and awaken the Islamic nation. The purpose of this Bazm is the same as that towards which Sheikh-ul-Hind Maulana Mahmud-ul-Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) guided in the last days of his life.</p>
                        <h3>You said:</h3>
                        <p>We learned two lessons in the Maltese captivity</p>
                        <p>(1) Abandoning the Quran is the cause of the destruction of the Ummah.</p>
                        <p>(2) Mutual differences and civil wars are the root of this decline.</p>
                        <p>So spread the Quran and eliminate differences.</p>
                        <p>Manifesto of Bazm-e-Zamir To popularize the literal and spiritual teaching of the Holy Quran To establish public Quran lessons and village schools To promote unity of the Ummah and mutual love and brotherhood To keep alive the scientific and reformist thought of the predecessors Invitation to participate We invite all scholars, students, scholars, and lovers of religion to Join this caravan of goodness — So that together we may popularize the message of the Quran And establish an atmosphere of brotherhood and agreement within the Muslim Ummah.</p>
                        <p>Come, be a part of this celebration of thought and faith where remembrance of ancestors enlightens hearts and the Quran gives direction to life.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div className="content">
                        <h1>O believers!</h1>
                        <p>Today, amidst the noise of the decline, division and anxiety of the Ummah, we are hearing a voice again — The voice that arose from the solitude of the Maltese prison, The voice that came from the depths of the heart of Sheikh-ul-Hind Maulana Mahmud-ul-Hasan (RA). This is the voice that reminds us that the cure for the Ummah is not in the noise of any slogan, any government or any movement, but in the light of the Quran and the relationship of mutual love. The Thoughts of Sheikh-ul-Hind (RA) — A Voice of Awakening After the trials of imprisonment and confinement, when you reached Darul Uloom Deoband, you spoke two sentences for the Ummah in which the foundation of an entire movement was hidden: The roots of the decline of the Ummah are two: One is distance from the Quran, and the other is differences among yourselves. These two sentences were actually the manifestos of the intellectual revolution. Sheikhul Hind (may Allah be pleased with him) diagnosed the illness of the Ummah and also gave the cure. That until the relationship with the Quran is revived and love is awakened in hearts, the destiny of the Ummah cannot change. Sheikhul Hind (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Quran needs to be not only read, but also applied in life. That Quran schools should be established in every village, That the candle of understanding the Quran should be lit in every heart, And that the message of the Quran should be revived in every home. The Quran is the book that lifts nations, But when they abandon it, they themselves fall. This movement is actually an invitation to make the Quran the center of life again - To schools, mosques, markets and homes. This is not a message of a specific group, This is a movement for the intellectual awakening of the Ummah. It is a movement to highlight the achievements of the ancestors.</p>
                        <p>Call for Unity and Love Sheikh al-Hind said that the second wound is the internal discord of the Ummah. Today, this same wound is weakening us from within. We have become distant from each other in the name of nationality, language, creed and politics. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: A believer is to another believer like two bricks, each supporting the other. A believer is to another believer like a brick, each supporting the other. The movement of Sheikh al-Hind calls us: Come, erase hatred, Turn differences into goodwill, And revive the concept of a single Ummah. It is time for us to revive Sheikh al-Hind’s mission in the form of an organized intellectual and reform movement. A movement that is born not from politics, but from the pain of the community and the spirit of service.</p>
                        <h3>The basic principles of this movement are:</h3>
                        <p>1. Understanding, reading, and popularizing the Holy Quran.</p>
                        <p>2. Creating intellectual connections between scholars, madrasas, students, and the public.</p>
                        <p>3. Creating a climate of dialogue, brotherhood, and goodwill instead of hatred and prejudice.</p>
                        <p>4. Connecting the younger generation with the consciousness of the Quran and the Seerah.</p>
                        <p>5. Making mosques and madrasas not just places of worship but centers of reformation of the Ummah.</p>
                        <p>This is the interpretation of Sheikh al-Hind’s dream — And this is the path to the salvation of the Ummah. O Muslims...! This call is not for a single person or group — It is a call for the collective awakening of the Ummah. Come, respond to this call. Make the Quran the law of life, And love and unity the motto of the Ummah. Make the Quran popular, eradicate differences, So that the Ummah becomes an Ummah again. O Allah, make us among those who work with the Quran, And gather our hearts together on Your love and obedience, And make us what enters from Your religion. Amen.</p>
