                        <h1>Allama Muhammad Yusuf Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him)</h1>
                        <p className='lead'>In the scientific and religious history of the subcontinent, the name of Allama Muhammad Yusuf Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him) is very prominent among those personalities who, through their sincerity and determination in applying their knowledge, improved the intellectual and practical aspects of the Ummah. He was not just a religious scholar but a movement that spread flowers in the fields of teaching, training, reform, invitation, statehood and leadership, and perfumed the nations. Allama Banuri was born in 1908 in an academic and religious family. He received his early education there and later went to Darul Uloom Deoband. Where he acquired knowledge from the professor's renowned teachers, such as Shaykh-ul-Islam Hazrat Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him), Maulana Hussain Ahmad Madani (may Allah have mercy on him) and Sheikh Yaqub Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him). In the sciences of Hadith, he had a special affinity and devotion, especially to Allama Usmani. This affinity later became the reason for Allama Banuri's life on many intellectual and practical roads. The most prominent aspect of his life is the establishment of Darul Uloom Islamia Banuri Town, Karachi, which today is an academic and intellectual center all over the world. This institution has produced hundreds of scholars and preachers who are engaged in the propagation, teaching and reformation of religion not only in Pakistan but also all over the world. This institution is actually a manifestation of Allama Banuri's sincerity, foresight and scholarly prowess. Allama Banuri was also a persuasive person and considered jihad as a struggle and ignored the differences between thinkers and ideologists. The courage and insight with which he established an academic and intellectual front against Qadianism, esoteric denial, Western colonialism and atheism is a clear proof of his religious zeal and devotion. His articles, statements and writings are still considered a source of guidance in the world today. His students and followers have always testified that Allama Banuri was just, a great scholar and preacher, a great scholar. Every speech of his was also an invitation, every time an Islamic message and every meeting an advice. You always called for unity of the Ummah, sincerity of action, and beneficial knowledge. Your role in the example, authority, knowledge, and inspiration of your religious services, in contrast to the scientific, intellectual, and practical aspects of Khatm-e-Nabvut, is an important chapter in the religious and intellectual journey of Pakistan's history. You fought for the preservation of religion and the mission of the Prophet and elevated the people as leaders of the nation. You departed this mortal world in 1977, but the movement you founded is still alive today. Every student of Jamia Uloom Islamia Banuri Town, every scholar, and the influence emanating from every pulpit is actually the legacy of your services.</p>
                        <p className='lead'>The service of religion is not only through sermons and advice, but also through knowledge, character and organization. Undoubtedly, the personality of Allama Muhammad Yusuf Banuri (may Allah have mercy on him) was such a movement that is still giving direction to the intellectual and religious journey of the Muslim Ummah today. His name has become a symbol of knowledge and action, insight and sincerity, and invitation and leadership.</p>
