        content: `<h1>Hazrat Maulana Zamir Ahmad Qureshi A Great Journey of Truth and Academic Perseverance<h1/>
        <h2>Family Background and Scholarly Heritage</h2>
        <p>​The history of Islam is a witness that family and upbringing play a major role in the cultivation of great personalities. Hazrat Maulana Zamir Ahmad Qureshi (may Allah have mercy on him) also belonged to such a scholarly and courageous family. The full name of his esteemed father was Maulana Ghulam Yahya Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him), who was a great religious scholar of his time and a fearless visionary. His esteemed father belonged to the great group of Syed Ahmed Shaheed and Shah Ismail Shaheed (may Allah have mercy on him) who sacrificed their lives for Islamic awakening in the subcontinent. </p>
        <h2>Birth and Childhood</h2>
        <p>Maulana Zameer Ahmad Qureshi was born in 1916 in Namli Mira, Abbottabad district, Pakistan. As soon as he regained consciousness, he felt the fragrance of knowledge and the yearning for religion in his home. His early education and training were under the shadow of his respected father, who instilled religious zeal in his veins. </p>
        <h2>A turning point in the pursuit of education</h2>
        <p>Considering your intelligence and academic ability, the government authorities of that time offered you admission to Nowshera High School. This offer included not only free education but also hostel accommodation and a monthly stipend. For an ordinary student, this was an attractive opportunity, but the eyes of a "sightseeing" and "mujahid" father were seeing something else.</p>
        <h2>Faithful Pride and Historic Decision </h2> 
        <p>When Maulana Ghulam Yahya Hashmi (RA) was offered this, he rejected it vehemently and expressed his religious pride in these words,</p>
        <p>We have a personal enmity with English, I consider English education to be a deadly poison. I will prepare my son not for worldly positions but for the exaltation of the religion of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and I will send him to Darul Uloom Deoband."</p>
       <p>This was the historic decision that determined the course of Maulana Zamir Ahmed Qureshi's life and made him the bright star of knowledge and wisdom whose light continues to benefit the world today.</p>

        content: `<p>The beginning of a conscious life was in 1928. The primary pass certificate was obtained from Peshawar, whose examiner was Sheikh Allah Din. He told his respected father Maulana Yahya Hashmi: Admit Zameer Ahmad Qureshi to Middle School Nawan Shahr Boarding, I will issue his scholarship. And I will provide Hostel</p>
        <h2>Father replied:</h2>
        <p>We will not provide English education. Because there was a natural hostility towards the English, and my father was at the forefront of opposing English civilization. Thus, formal school education was ended here, but the journey of religious knowledge continued with full force.</p>

        content: `<h2>A reformer, a practical teacher and a preacher of monotheism and the Sunnah</h2>
        <h2>Early life and education</h2> 
        <p>In 1916, in the Bagnotar Valley of Abbottabad, a mountainous region of the subcontinent, a child was born whose forehead was adorned with the light of knowledge and action — he was Maulana Zamir Ahmad Qureshi Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him). He belonged to a religious and scholarly family. His father, Hazrat Maulana Ghulam Yahya Qureshi Hashmi, was a prominent religious scholar and a righteous person of the area.</p>
        <p>He received his early education from his father, then studied elementary books in the schools of village Rewaiya and Kokal Barsin. The passion for religious knowledge was in him since childhood, and this passion took him to India, where he enrolled in Darul Uloom Deoband.</p>
        <h2>Educational journey and company of elders</h2>
        <p>During his education, he was in the company of great scholars of the subcontinent. After Deoband, he was associated with the academic centers of Abheel and Saharanpur. Here he was blessed with the discipleship of the great Muhaddith, Quranic commentator and the spirit of the Pakistan Movement, Hazrat Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani (may Allah have mercy on him). Under his patronage, he improved his knowledge and perfected his religious studies.</p>
        <h2>Bagnutar's return and reformist struggle<h2/>
        <p>When he returned home after completing his education in 1939, the darkness of polytheism and innovation was shrouding the village. He took up the duty of reforming the nation and lit the candle of truth in this environment with great wisdom and patience.</p>
        <h2>His principle was that he would not make religion a means of earning worldly gain.</h2>
        <p>With this aim in mind, he joined the Army Medical Corps (A.M.C) in search of a halal livelihood and served as a nursing soldier for four years.</p>
        <h2>Teaching Journey</h2>
        <p>In 1946, he joined the Education Department and was appointed as a primary school teacher. His teaching career enlightened countless minds. His distinguished students include: Justice Sardar Raza Khan (Namli Mira), Sardar Muhammad Riaz (Former Secretary C&W), Sardar Rahim Dad, Sardar Farhan. Along with teaching, he performed the duties of Imamat and Khattab in mosques and imparted religious awareness to hundreds of people.</p>
        <p>In 1953, he was appointed as an Islamic teacher at Government High School Ghazi. Later, he served at Sirikot, Nawanshahr and finally at High School Bagnotar. His total teaching tenure spanned 38 years.</p>
        <h2>Tablighi and Reformatory Services</h2>
        <p>After retirement in 1975, he turned his life towards purely religious and missionary work. He spent a long period of one year with the Tablighi Jamaat and on his return, he served as a preacher in various mosques, including: Jamia Masjid Upper Kahal, Jamia Masjid Murree Jami Masjid Dilkha Marree, Jamia Masjid Habibullah Colony, Jamia Masjid Sawar Gali.</p>
       <h2>Madrasa Islamia Taleeluddin and Jamia Masjid Quba Bagnutr</h2>
       <p>In his last years, he accomplished a great religious feat in the village of Bagnutr. He founded the Jamia Masjid Quba and the Islamic Madrasa Taalimuddin Jamilabad Bagnutr, which was later registered with the Federation of Arab Schools in Pakistan (Multan). This institution proved to be a source of light of knowledge and faith for the boys and girls of the village and its surroundings. Under the auspices of the Federation of Arab Schools in Pakistan, dozens of male and female students graduated from here adorned with the ornaments of religious education. This madrasa was established in the memory of Hafiz and Qari Sagheer Ahmed Qureshi, Shaheed (may Allah have mercy on him), which is an ongoing charity for his family.</p>.
       <h2>Farewell</h2>
       <p>This man of truth, this patient teacher, this preacher of religion appeared before his true Creator in 2011. We belong to Allah and we shall return. Maulana Zamir Ahmad Qureshi (may Allah have mercy on him) has four sons (Shabbir Ahmad Qureshi, Hazrat Maulana Jamil Ahmad Qureshi Shaheed (may Allah have mercy on him), Zaheer Ahmad Qureshi, Hafiz Qari Sagheer Ahmad Qureshi Shaheed (may Allah have mercy on him) and two daughters.</p>
       <p>His memory still resonates in the doors and walls of Bagnutr. His students, Mutawassilin, and scholars pay tribute to his character and service. Maulana Zamir Ahmad Qureshi Hashmi (may Allah have mercy on him) was not only a religious scholar and teacher, but he was a movement. The Movement of Knowledge and Reform, the Movement of Sincerity and Action. The Movement of Rejecting Bid’at and Shirk, the Movement of Revival of the Sunnah. His life teaches us this lesson Learning religion is worship, teaching religion is service, and adhering to religion is the highest level of closeness to God.</p>
